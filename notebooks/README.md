## Visualize Data on a Map

To visualize the ongevallen dataset, the hectopunten dataset including coloring by segmentation scheme, the weather stations, and the induction loop network, run the Create_Map_with_Feature_Overlay.ipynb file. The resulting map will be saved in the notebooks directory as a feature_overlay_map_{segmentation scheme}.html file. To change the segmentation scheme which you which to visualizeedit the config settings at the beginning of the notebook.

The resulting map will include a layer for each dataset.  Press the layers icon at the top right corner of the screen to uncheck and recheck different layers, and toggle different map views. Each hectopunten segment is randomly assigned a color, and you can click on segments to view the segment name.  You can also click on the ongevallen markers to see details on when the accidents occurred and click on the weather station markers to read the weather station name.
